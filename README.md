# generator-alloy [![Build Status](https://secure.travis-ci.org/dbankier/generator-alloy.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/dbankier/generator-alloy)

An [alloy](http://projects.appcelerator.com/alloy/docs/Alloy-bootstrap/index.html) 
 generator for [Yeoman](http://yeoman.io) based on the [JAST stack](https://github.com/dbankier/JAST) but configurable.



## Getting Started

### What is Yeoman?

Basically, he wears a top hat, lives in your computer, and waits for you to tell him what kind of application you wish to create.

To install:

```
$ npm install -g yo
```

### JALT Generators


To install generator-alloy from npm, run:

```
$ npm install -g generator-alloy
```

Finally, initiate the generator:

```
$ yo alloy
```

The generator gives you more options than JAST:

```
$ yo alloy
